		<h1>CubicTest and agile software development</h1>

		<p>
			The main reason why CubicTest was created was to fill a gap in the tools that support agile software development
			(e.g. eXtreme Programming) of web applications.
			There were few or no tools that let the "customer" (non-technical / business-side person) easily write the tests
			of a web application, let alone a tool that provided the visual abstractions needed to make the customer
			comfortable with writing the tests <em>before</em> the application was implemented.
		</p>

		<p>
			The goal of CubicTest is to make it easy and fun to write web-application tests, for both technical and non-technical people.
			These tests should ideally be written by the "owner" of the functionality, and preferrably before the 
			application is implemented, such that the tests can be used in all phases of the application under construction.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Benefits of test-driven development of features in a web application</h2>

		<strong>Tests written in CubicTest can be used</strong>
		<ol style="margin-top: 3px;">
			<li>as input to the developer when a feature is about to be implemented,
			<li>for specifying changes to existing functionality,
			<li>to report bugs (represent interaction and input that led to the bug),
			<li>to regression test existing features when changes are made, and
			<li>for performance tests (future work).
		</ol>
			
		<p>
			All the above would be in the form of failing tests, and the developer's job would be to make the tests pass.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			In line with eXtreme Programming practice, the tests should be written only when they are needed.
			This is typically in a development iteration where a particular user story is going to be implemented and 
			needs to be detailed. At this time, as much information about the requirements as possible should be 
			contained in the tests.
		</p>

			The following figure is an attempt to illustrate how CubicTest is used when implementing a user story:
