			<h1>Welcome to functional web testing with CubicTest!</h1>
			<p>
				CubicTest is a visual Eclipse plug-in for writing functional tests for web applications. Tests can 
				be run using different underlying test frameworks, e.g. the provided Selenium and Watir exporters in CubicTest. 
				CubicTest makes web tests faster and easier to write, as well as making it easier to write "tests first".
			</p>
			<p>
				CubicTest's graphical test editor is centered around pages/states and transitions between these pages/states.
				The model is intuitive for both Ajax and traditional web applications and supports most user interaction types.
			</p>
			<p>
				CubicTest is focused around testing "what you see" on the page, and not
				"testing the HTML source". To support this, CubicTest introduces a "context" principle which 
				makes it possible for page elements to be identified by sibling elements, and not just by HTML attributes.
				Another feature of CubicTest is that page elements (and contexts) easily can be identified by multiple identifiers at the same time 
				(e.g. "id" and "name").
			</p>
			<p>
				CubicTest comes with an extensible plugin architecture for running/exporting the tests and for recording new tests. 
				Among the implementations provided are a Selenium RC test runner and Maven 2 plugin, a Selenium Core exporter and a Watir exporter.
				A recorder based on Selenium RC is also provided for recording directly into the Eclipse perspective, as well as a 
				HTML mock-up exporter that can be used during test-driven development.
